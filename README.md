An integration between discord and slack using webhooks and discord bots.

## Core Dependency

This package's core dependency is [Discord.js](https://discordjs.guide/)

## Usage
- No NPM package at this time, but is under heavy consideration.

## Development

### Getting started
1. [Install Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started)
2. Install dependencies
```sh
yarn
```
3. Setup Bots:
   - If you are working with contributors directly then _ask us for slack/discord bot secrets_, and skip the other bullet points. _(Continue to step 4)_.
   - If you are leveraging this package to setup your own discord -> slack bot you will first need to go manually setup your server bots.
       - One discord bot that can be used by `Discord.js`
       - One slack bot that is configured for "Incoming Webhooks".
4. From the root directory create a new dotenv configuration _(This will contain secrets so it is not checked into Git)_.
    - From the root directory `touch .env`
    - Add your discord bot **token** and your slack **webhook url** to `.env.` _Please refer to .env.example file checked into GitHub_.
